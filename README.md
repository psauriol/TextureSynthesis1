TextureSynthesis1
=================
This program takes an input image (by dragging the image file onto the executable) and generates a larger texture from it.

This program uses a pixel based approach roughly modeled on the work of Efros and Leung.
It works fairly well but has a tendancy to grow garbage along the edges.

TODO fix garbage growth (possibly by changing the order pixels are chosen in)


The Colour and Image .cpp and .h files were created by my professor Alejo Hausner and modified by me to fit my needs.
The remaining work is my own.
